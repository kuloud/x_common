[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
